# bambu-gcode-tweaks

Tweak gcode on print start and print end to perform actions concurrently in order to save time.

## Disclaimer

This is my first foray into writing gcode manually, use at your own risk!

## Credits

This project incorporates the gcode from https://makerworld.com/en/models/91241 to reduce waste on filament change.
